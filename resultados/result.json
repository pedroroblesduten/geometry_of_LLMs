{"input_prompt": "write a paragraph to continue the story that follows.: \n'COMING INTO MOHER over the bridge, you may see a terrace of houses by the river. They are to the left of the bridge, below it. Their narrow height and faded air of importance make them seem to mark the approach to some larger town. The six dwellings unite into one frontage, colour-washed apricot years ago. They face north. Their lower sash windows, front steps and fanlit front doors are screened by lime trees, making for privacy. There are area railings. Between them and the water runs a road with a parapet, which comes to its end opposite the last house.'", "generated_text": "\n\nIn the small town of Moher, the houses along the river were a source of pride for the locals. They were built in the 19th century by a wealthy family who wanted to create a picturesque and private community. The houses were designed with tall ceilings, large windows, and intricate moldings, giving them an air of elegance and sophistication. Over the years, the family's fortunes had waned, and the houses had been sold off to various owners, but they remained a testament to the town's rich history. Despite their faded grandeur, the houses were still well-maintained and continued to be a source of admiration for visitors to the town."}
